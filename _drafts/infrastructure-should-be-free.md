In my last blog post, I stated that Stage1's source code might become open in a more or less near future. Well, it'll be more near than less, because I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of the integrality of [Stage1's source code at GitHub](https://github.com/stage1/stage1).

Why the sudden decision, you ask? Well there are two main reasons:

First, infrastructure should be open, and Stage1 is, to an extent, infrastructure. You might not want to make your business critical source code available to any third party service out there, and you are perfectly right. Some companies deal with that by offering *Enterprise* edition of their services, we choose to do it by opensourcing our product (which does not mean there's not going to be an *enterprise* distribution of Stage1).

Second reason is more personal. Opensource has been the foundation of my entire professional life. Everything I work with, every technology I know and use on a daily basis. All of that exists because of opensource, and I am immensely grateful to the people who devoted and still devote their time to free and opensource software. Opensourcing Stage1 is my way of repaying the community.

Anyway, what are the consequences for the future of Stage1? Except that you're now able to see the code and laugh at the poor quality of it (it's all *prototype quality*, and really I'm not proud of it), not much. We will, continue to provide Stage1 as a *SaaS* free of charge for opensource, and offer paying plans for private projects as a manner to support the development effort of the platform. Source code will undergo drastic refactoring in the coming days, to clean things up and bring the overall quality up to acceptable quality. Finally, we will publish a roadmap so you can see where Stage1 is headed and continue development like before, hopefuly with a few contributions here and there.
