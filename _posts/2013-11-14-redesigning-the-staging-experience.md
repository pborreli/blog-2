You may call it staging or pre-production, it boils down to one simple concept: to make a version of your project available before production. Be it for running integration test, getting product owner feedback, internal feature reviewing, you name it. Having a staging environment is useful in more than one ways, but it often ryhtmes pain. Pain to setup, pain to maintain, pain to deploy.

Staging should not be painful. That is the mission we set ourselves up to, making staging the way it should be: __easy__, __automatic__ and __painless__.

We already have a few ideas how the staging of the future will look like, but of course, we can't do it alone. We need you, we need to know more about how you do staging, and what problems you're encountering. If you'd like to help, or just want to be kept in touch, participate in the private beta maybe? there are already a few things you can do!

* [__Answer our quick survey__](http://stage1.io/survey). It's quick and easy, 10 questions, 2 minutes top.
* [__Register for the private beta__](http://stage1.io/beta), that one's obvious.
* [__Contact us!__](mailto:geoffrey@stage1.io) Have something to say about staging? Want to share your story? Do you have some ideas on how it should be done? We'd love to hear from you!

In the meantime, we will regularly publish progress and general technical articles about technologies we use and develop to build stage1 (you can already read a bit about [docker containers linking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-11-15-making-docker-containers-communicate %})) on this blog, so stay tuned!
